File system: to develop a web, we need IIS to be installe. However, even IIS is not installed, we can use local computer to develop  using IIS express-a web server that comes with visual studio. 
When we use file system, our application will be running on IIS Express.


Can create a website using both 
IIS Express :IIS contains a default webiste, we create avirtual directory and run.  It is directly going to create a site and runs a .aspx file. 
https://localhost:44319/Shopping_sysytem.aspx
https://localhost:44373/sample.aspx

Local IIS: Local host is already created,Virtual directory is created on that particular site as second site, and under that I create a .aspx file. 

Installed IIS Manager
Website created from Web application works on IIS express only. 


Here,
I cerated a header and footer page using web user control separately and added together in master page.
The picture are uploaded in the project to make it easy to display. 
Then created a wed master page for the middle content.
